bd->inbufCount	  - bytes were read from input file into bd->inbuf
bd->inbufPos	  - amount of bytes were read from bd->inbuf
bd->inbufBits	  - int accum. << 8 bits from bd->inbuf
bd->inbufBitCount - amount of unprocessed bits that were read
		    into bd->inbufBits
length[]	  - lengths of all symbols within a huffman group
permute[]	  - index of length[] if length[] == i, where 
		    minLen >= i <= maxLen
temp[]		  - amount of symbols of every lengthc
